# Alarm328

Repository for my BCD alarm clock, including BreadBoard Schematics, my own custom PCB Gerber files, and the code for the ATmega328P.

Rough parts list:

* 1x ATmega328P
* ~24x 3V 5mm LEDs
* ~24x 100-150 Ohm Resistors (THT)
* 1x PCB, AlarmClock.zip for Gerber
* 3x 74HC595 Shift Registers
* 2x KY-040 Rotary Encoders
* 2x Momentary Push Buttons
* 1x 10k Ohm Resistor
* 2x ~1uF Capacitors for switch debouncing
* Many PCB Headers

As you can see below, the project is essentially finished (except for the hours output / LEDs & resistors). I've got it working, however I don't have the time to design a proper / aesthetic enclosure for the clock, so it remains in this semi unfinished state, though it certainly fulfilled its purpose in teaching me the basics of PCB / electronics design.
