Repository for my BCD alarm clock, including BreadBoard Schematics, PCB Gerber files, and the code for the ATmega328P.

My parts list (will not always be the same):

* 1x ATmega328P
* ~24x 3V 5mm LEDs
* ~24x 100-150 Ohm Resistors (THT)
* 1x PCB, AlarmClock.zip for Gerber
* 3x 74HC595 Shift Registers
* 2x KY-040 Rotary Encoders
* 2x Momentary Push Buttons
* 1x 10k Ohm Resistor
* 2x ~1uF Capacitors for switch debouncing
* Many PCB Headers
